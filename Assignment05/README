Homework Assignment #5              ELEC 5760/6760           Due: Wednesday 2/20/13
  1) A MEMS device consists of a proof mass attached to a frame with a suspension
     system. The bottom of the proof mass is 1mm by 1mm in size and serves as an
     electrode. Another electrode of the same size is located 2µm beneath it. If the
     proof mass can move up and down ±1µm from its nominal distance to the bottom
     electrodes, calculate the nominal, maximum and minimum capacitance between
     the two electrodes. Assume that the device is in a vacuum.
  2) A certain MEMS capacitance has a rest (i.e. nominal) value of 3pF, a minimum
     value of 2pF and a maximum value of 5pF. Place it in a charge amplifier circuit
     that has an input voltage of 10V and a feedback capacitor (C2) of 10pF. Calculate
     the amplifier output voltage (at the end of the 2phi cycle) for the nominal, minimum
     and maximum capacitance values.
  3) For the MEMS capacitance in (2) place it in a 5V "fast" CMOS ring oscillator
     circuit with both resistors being 100k. What is the output frequency for Cmin,
     Cnom and Cmax?
  4) If two MEMS capacitances from (2) are placed in a capacitive AC voltage divider
     to realize a differential capacitive sensor configuration, with the input voltage
     having an amplitude of 10V, what is the output voltage amplitude for each case?
  5) If the MEMS capacitance from (2) is placed in a switched-capacitor circuit that is
     switched at 250KHz, what is the value of the equivalent resistance for the
     nominal, minimum and maximum capacitance values?
  6) If the MEMS device in (2) is placed in an RC phase delay circuit, where R = 250
     k, what is the phase delay in µs for the nominal, minimum and maximum
     capacitance values?
