Homework Assignment #6               ELEC 5760/6760                Due: Wed 3/27/13
  1) A parallel plate actuator (PPA) consists of two square electrodes, 500µm on a
     side, separated by 10µm, in a vacuum. What is the force produced if 100V DC is
     applied across the electrodes
  2) If a sinusoidal voltage with a 100V amplitude is applied to the PPA in (1), where
     the frequency of the voltage signal is much higher than the natural frequency of
     the mechanical system, what is the average force produced by the PPA?
  3) For the PPA in (1), if the system spring constant is 50N/m, what is the pull-in
     voltage?
  4) If the PPA in (1) is used with the spring in (3), what applied DC voltage will
     decrease the distance between the electrodes by 1µm.
  5) An object is moving away from a 20KHz sound source at 10m/s. If the speed of
     sound in air is 331m/s, what is the frequency of the reflected sound wave?
  6) If the object in (5) is moving toward the sound source, what is the frequency of
     the return sound wave?
