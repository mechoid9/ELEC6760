Homework Assignment #7               ELEC 5760/6760                Due: Mon 4/3/13
  1) Estimate the depth in the ocean that the static pressure is 50% due to the water
     depth and 50% due to the air pressure above the water. Use 1G = 9.8 m/s2 and 1
     g/cm3 for the density of sea water, and 1atm for the air pressure.
  2) A MEMS submarine is being used to monitor the cooling fluid in an industrial
     transformer. The transformer fluid (liquid) has a density of 2 g/cm3. The sub is in
     motion and measures the total pressure (1960.1 Pa) and the static pressure (1960
     Pa) that it experiences, using gage pressure sensors. For 1G = 9.8 m/s2, estimate
     the velocity of the sub in mm/s?
  3) For the sub in (6), what is the depth of the sub in mm, ignoring atmospheric
     pressure?
  4) For the pressure sensor diaphragm shown below, the four identical P-type
     piezoresistors have a gauge factor of +180:
     a. Under pressure, is each resistor in compression or tension?
     b. Under pressure, has each resistor increased or decreased in resistance?
  5) Estimate the acceleration level of a shock event of a 1Kg object falling 10m onto
     a hard surface where it completely stops moving 10ms after initial impact. (1G =
     9.8 m/s2)
