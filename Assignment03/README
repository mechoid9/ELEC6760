  1) Consider the transmissibility plot for a MEM device with a 100µg proof mass
     shown in plot1.PNG:

a. What is Q?
b. What is the damping ratio?
c. What is the natural frequency in KHz?
d. What is the spring constant?
e. What is the damping coefficient?
f. If the device is excited with a sinusoidal input at its natural frequency with an
   amplitude of 0.2µm, what is the amplitude of the proof mass displacement at that
   frequency?
g. For the input in (f), what is the maximum acceleration experienced by the proof
   mass, in G's [1G=9.8m/s2]?
h. What is the expression for T(s) for this device?
i. Using Matlab with an m-file, plot |T(j)|. Turn in your plot (in a similar format to
   the one above (it should look very similar, but with less noise)) AND you m-file.
